# Flood-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
We utilized machine learning classification models to predict flood occurrences through the analysis of rainfall data.
The model incorporates essential inputs data such as topographic attributes (topographic wetness index, depth to water, elevation) and environmental factors (hourly rainfall, cumulative prior rainfall, hourly tide levels, etc.
The approach involves employing diverse ML algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to anticipate floods by leveraging rainfall data.
